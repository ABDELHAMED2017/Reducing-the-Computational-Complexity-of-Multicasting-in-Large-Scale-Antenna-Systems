# Reducing-the-Computational-Complexity-of-Multicasting-in-Large-Scale-Antenna-Systems
This repository contains the set of functions required to implement the heuristic multicasting proposed in our latest work. As the work is under reviewe, we just present the function required to implement our heuristic algorithm. This repository will be updated, if we get accepted. The main idea behind this code sharing, is to promote reproducible research.

Thank you for your kind attention to our work.
